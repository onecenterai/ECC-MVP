at the core, we need to be able to communicate with the ai model

How do determine "complex cases" in order to know when to forward a call?
For now the only heuristic we would use is, the presence of casualties...

so if human life is at stake, or harm has been done to human life, then we would forward the call to a human agent, 
other wise we would just send a notification, to the corresponding agency.

scenario 1: Very Critical Accident (Complex Scenario)

A: Hello, How can I help you today?
H: Hello, There has been a fire accident
A: Could you please tell me the location of this accident, and tell me if there are casualties at this location 
H: The accident happend at X-Place, and there are people insode the buring building
A: Okay I would notify the fire service, and the ambulance now, and forward your call to a human agent?

scenario 2: Less Critical Accident (Simple Scenario)

A: Hello, How can I help you today?
H: Hello, there has been an electrical accident, one of the wire poles in my street has fallen down
A: Okay, could you please tell me the name of your street, and tell me if there are currently any casualties as this location
H: Okay, the name of my street is Y-street, for now, there's no human life at risk.
A: Alright, I would notify the fire service, and the electrical agency incharge.
# Agent would proceed to tell the human to avoid the area around the fire pole, in order to not get electricuted
